# Voting Dapp on Stellar Blockchain

## Project Description

Our project aims to develop a decentralized application (Dapp) for conducting secure and transparent voting processes using the Stellar blockchain. This Dapp will enable users to cast their votes securely from anywhere, ensuring integrity and eliminating the risk of manipulation. 

The system will authenticate voters through unique identifiers and record their votes on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency. Smart contracts will govern the voting process, ensuring that each user's vote is counted accurately and cannot be altered once cast. 

Additionally, the Dapp will provide real-time access to voting results, allowing stakeholders to monitor the progress of the election. 

With Stellar's fast transaction processing and low fees, our Voting Dapp promises efficiency and accessibility, revolutionizing the way elections are conducted.
